                    As adjacent grid items are independently containde within the
                    containing block formed by their <a href="#">grid areas,</a> the
                    margins of adjacent <a href="#">frid items</a> do not
                    <a href="#">collapse.</a>

                    Percentage margins and paddings on <a href="#">grid items</a> can be
                    resolved against either:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        their own axis (left/rigiht percents resolve aginst width,
                        top/bottom resolce aginst height), or,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the inline axis (left/right/top/bottom percentages all roselve
                        aginst widht)
                    </li>

                        Note: This variance sucks, but it accurately captures the
                        currentstate of the world (no consensus among im--plementatins,
                        and no consensus within the <span>csswgs</span>). It is the
                        <span>ssswg</span>`s intention that browsers will con-verge on one
                        of the behaviors, at whitch time the spec will be amended to
                        reqire that.
